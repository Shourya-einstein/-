<h1>What is Dark Web?</h1>
<p>In simple words, WEB can be defined as Internet which we use.There are mainly three parts of the web. First is simple web which contains about the normal things which we use in daily life such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, Messanger, and many more such apps or websites which are interconnected to each other.
</p>
<br>
<p> Next part of the web is deep web about which only some people know and it is the thing which always repeatedly continuing inside the world. This DEEP WEB contains all the information about us. It stores the data of our privacy, money, google etc. If this data will be leaked then it might be a big risk to the whole world because all of our data will have acess to public and thus everyone can acess it. There is also a chance that we may become bankruput.

<h2> Welcome to the Dark Web!</h2>
<p> This is the Dark Web and as the name suggests it is a lot darker than we may even think. But this was not until 2000's that people of bad mindset started using it. It's history goes back to the 1940's when America was facing against Japan during World War 2. America has sent some of their secret spies in Japan to search about their planning towards America. The spies were sometimes detected and were killed. To prevent this America made a plan to build a prototype through which they can talk to their spies anonymously. And in such a way was built the Tor browser which was till then not shown to public. In 2000's when technology was just growing the Americans thought to launch their browser worldwide and make its acess to everyone. They launced it so that everyone would use it as Whatsapp which we use today to talk to our friends or relatives even if they are thousands of miles away from us. But after some time it was used by anonymous users who sold kidneys in black market by online process. After some more time people came to use Tor as a dark web where they did crimes or mental harrassment to the hostages which they kidnapped and such people sometimes killed some people and telecasted to users who have subscribed to their account. They took money from users to watch such content. Their were also some people who were using it as a place to make black money by doing fraud. They asked the people about their bank account in such a way so that people may believe on them. Until 2008 no action was took on it because neither a lot of people knew about it nor the police. In 2009, the police also started using the dark web to detect and know about the criminals. After they knew it they contacted them and took information and when they had full information, they jailed them. In such a way, about 1000 users of dark web were arrested. But still thousands of dark web users are continuing to do such crimes. Strict action should be taken on them.
